### Design Features
- Accurate spacing and typography matching the original

## Files Structure
```
FoodDeliveryApp.swift          # Main app entry point
ContentView.swift              # Root content view

```

## Usage

2. Ensure you have SwiftUI enabled (iOS 13+)
3. Run the app to see the recreated interface

## Notes
